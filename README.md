This must be set to the `lilypond` executable. The default path for Linux is `/usr/bin/lilypond`, the default path for
Windows is `C:\Program Files (x86)\LilyPond\usr\bin\lilypond-windows.exe`.

## How to use

Write a code-block in your markdown files like so:

			\layout {}
		}
	```

The plugin allows for any kind of lilypond code to be used at this point in time.
